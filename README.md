# Bamazon - mysql & node application

##### In this activity, I have created an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL and Node. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. Additionally there is a program on the app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
